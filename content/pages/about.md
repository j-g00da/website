## Hi!

I'm Jagoda. I click keyboard.
I have [approximate knowledge about many things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDS-iSueBQ4).
I'm hopefully [doing stuff](/do-stuff).

`#[non_exhaustive]`  
I'm into open source tooling, terminal/text UI, algorithmic music, analog synthesis, pixelart, utility poles,
LEGO, embedded systems, sociopsychological science fiction, painting, stop-motion animation, paralysis by analysis, 
shoegaze, reverse engineering, 3d printing, superdeterminism, eating cheese, space exploration, DIY UAVs etc.

<marquee>I'm also looking for someone that will infodump me about Zig.</marquee>

I spent most of my life tinkering on my own (for many reasons).
Since 2025 I've started sharing my work and got very involved in foss/hacking communities.

## What's going on?

Recent things:
- I made [Ratatui](https://ratatui.rs) run on [embedded devices](https://github.com/j-g00da/mousefood)
and [inside itself](https://github.com/j-g00da/ratrioshka), 
and lead the process of introducing [`no_std`](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/issues/1750) compatibility.
I gave talks about it at [P.I.W.O. 2025](https://piwo.sh), [Rust Gdańsk #9](https://www.meetup.com/rust-gdansk/events/308349712), 
[Rust Poland x Poznań](https://www.meetup.com/rust-poland-meetup/events/308480357) and [Jesień Linuksowa 2025](https://jesien.org).
- I'm oxidizing package management on Arch Linux as part of the [ALPM](https://alpm.archlinux.page) team, mostly working on
python bindings ([python-alpm](https://pypi.org/project/python-alpm/)) and file parsers.
Oh and check out my browser-crashing [AUR mirror](https://github.com/j-g00da/aur-git-looking-glass).
- I also made [serde_more](https://github.com/j-g00da/serde-more) and 
[embedded-graphics-unicodefonts](https://github.com/j-g00da/embedded-graphics-unicodefonts)

Back in 2019~2022 I prototyped a _bunch_ of custom eurorack modules, some of these are modifications of
existing designs, some are completely original.
I've moved my system (that is built almost completely with these custom modules) to [hsldz](https://lodz.hackerspace.pl),
you can come visit and play with it if you want! We are also [jamming](https://fosstodon.org/@j_g00da/115627837303523621)
there every other Thursday.
