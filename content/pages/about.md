## Hi!

I’m Jagoda and this is my little blog, created for my personal therapy and your entertainment.
I’m an open source enthusiast and Rust advocate, a full-stack dev, a self-proclaimed artist, and a full-time tinkerer.

<!-- more -->

### I’m currently working on:
- **_Finding a job_** \
The last contract ended pretty abruptly when a potential client didn’t get funding and suddenly there was no work for me
to do anymore. _(So I’m open for work and can start immediately, 
contact me if you have some interesting project I can help with!)_
- **Ratatui v0.30 release** \
This will be the biggest release since forking tui-rs and I’m really excited about it! 
I took part in making Ratatui no-std compatible which I hope will result in it being useful in many new places.
- **Mousefood v0.3 release** \
This release most importantly will make use of no-std compatibility of Ratatui 0.30, which will expand its usages 
beyond esp32 _(It already runs on PSP!)_
- **This blog** \
Hi! :D

### Ideas in early stages, that I want to tackle this year:
- **Rust VGA driver for esp32** \
I have this crazy idea to give a talk which is presented directly from a microcontroller, 
this is essential to make it possible.
- **Kloshel programming language** \
A weird LISP dialect and interpreter written in Rust. I haven’t open-sourced it yet, mostly an experiment.
- **Get back into self-hosting and painting** \
This obviously first requires finding a job.

## What is this blog?

As my 2025 resolution, I decided to start living instead of waiting for perfect conditions. This blog is a partial, 
public, and sometimes non-obvious diary of how I’m doing, where I post relevant thoughts and things I’m personally 
proud of—things that may be of interest to you, the reader. The main topics should be open source and Rust, 
but I won’t necessarily limit myself to those and may include anything I feel like yapping about.

I’ve loved the idea of open source for years, but since software development is my job, it was insanely hard for me to 
justify "working for free." FOSDEM 2025 was a turning point for me: I joined because I wanted to be part of this 
amazing community and stayed for the joy of being able to work on anything that interests me. In April 2025, 
I created Mousefood and became a maintainer of Ratatui in June. 

To both share what interests me and to fight my anxiety, I decided to start giving talks. I gave a lightning talk, 
"Ratatui na sterydach," at PIWO 2025 and a full-length talk, "Ratatui - Are We Embedded Yet?" at Rust Gdańsk #9 and 
Rust Poland x Poznań meetups. I hope to do more talks in the future, 
and presenting at FOSDEM is one of my personal goals.

## Open Source and Community

## Art

During the pandemic, I decided to start doing art as a hobby and mostly practiced painting still lives. 
I then studied graphic design (while still studying computer science and working as a web dev, which was rough...). 
I dropped out, as I mostly enjoyed painting but chose graphic design because it "made more sense" - a hard lesson. 
It was also a tough time in my life and I had to take care of other things...

I really hope to get back to painting in 2025.

## Tinkering

While at university, I created many custom Eurorack modules and cases. I hope to finally make a post about them.

## Music

Since I built a custom modular synth... I also made some music. 
I don’t really publish much though (as I don’t really finish much either).
